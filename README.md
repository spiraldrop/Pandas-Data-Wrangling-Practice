# Pandas-Data-Wrangling-Practice

In this Jupyter Notebook project, I practiced the following aspects of Pandas data manipulation:

1. Creating a DataFrame.
2. Displaying a summary of basic statistics.
3. Slicing and selecting data.
4. Filtering and selecting columns.
5. Aggregating data.
6. Appending and removing rows.
7. Counting the number of bird types.
8. Sorting data.
9. Replacing values.
10. Renaming entries.

This project demonstrates my Pandas skills and serves as a reference for future data analysis tasks.
